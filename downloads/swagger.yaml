          /status/{status} - returns only datasets with a given status, either 'active', 'deactivated', or 'in_preparation'.
          /tag/{tag} - returns only datasets tagged with the given tag.
          /{data_quality}/{range} - returns only tasks for which the underlying datasets have certain qualities. {data_quality} can be data_id, data_name, data_version, number_instances, number_features, number_classes, number_missing_values. {range} can be a specific value or a range in the form 'low..high'. Multiple qualities can be combined, as in 'number_instances/0..50/number_features/0..10'.

          /status/{status} - returns only tasks with a given status, either 'active', 'deactivated', or 'in_preparation'.
          /type/{type_id} - returns only tasks with a given task type id. See the list of task types of the ID's (e.g. 1 = Supervised Classification).
          /tag/{tag} - returns only tasks tagged with the given tag.
          /data_tag/{tag} - returns only tasks for which the underlying dataset is tagged with the given tag.
          /{data_quality}/{range} - returns only tasks for which the underlying datasets have certain qualities. {data_quality} can be data_id, data_name, number_instances, number_features, number_classes, number_missing_values. {range} can be a specific value or a range in the form 'low..high'. Multiple qualities can be combined, as in 'number_instances/0..50/number_features/0..10'.

The model is evaluated using a train-test procedure, e.g. cross-validation.<br><br>\n\nTo make results by different users comparable, you are given the exact train-test folds to be used, and you need to return at least the predictions generated by your model for each of the test instances. OpenML will use these predictions to calculate a range of evaluation measures on the server.<br><br>\n\nYou can also upload your own evaluation measures, provided that the code for doing so is available from the implementation used. For extremely large datasets, it may be infeasible to upload all predictions. In those cases, you need to compute and provide the evaluations yourself.<br><br>\n\nOptionally, you can upload the model trained on all the input data. There is no restriction on the file format, but please use a well-known format or PMML.",

          /per_fold/{true,false} - whether or not to return crossvalidation scores per fold. Defaults to 'false'. Setting it to 'true' leads to large numbers of results, use only for very specific sets of runs.
