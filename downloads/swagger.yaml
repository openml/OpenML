The model is evaluated using a train-test procedure, e.g. cross-validation.<br><br>\n\nTo make results by different users comparable, you are given the exact train-test folds to be used, and you need to return at least the predictions generated by your model for each of the test instances. OpenML will use these predictions to calculate a range of evaluation measures on the server.<br><br>\n\nYou can also upload your own evaluation measures, provided that the code for doing so is available from the implementation used. For extremely large datasets, it may be infeasible to upload all predictions. In those cases, you need to compute and provide the evaluations yourself.<br><br>\n\nOptionally, you can upload the model trained on all the input data. There is no restriction on the file format, but please use a well-known format or PMML.",

        List runs, filtered by a range of properties. Any number of properties can be combined by listing them one after the other in the form '/run/list/{filter}/{value}/{filter}/{value}/...' Returns an array with all runs that match the constraints. A maximum of 10,000 results are returned, an error is returned if the result set is bigger. Use pagination (via limit and offset filters), or limit the results to certain tasks, flows, setups, or uploaders.

      description: >
        List evaluations, filtered by a range of properties.

Returns an array with all evaluations that match the constraints. A maximum of 10,000 results are returned, an error is returned if the result set is bigger. Use pagination (via limit and offset filters), or limit the results to certain tasks, flows, setups, uploaders or runs.

            /function/{name} - name of the evaluation measure, e.g. area_under_auc or predictive_accuracy. See the OpenML website for the complete list of measures.
            /tag/{tag} - returns only evaluations of runs tagged with the given tag.
            /run/{ids} - return only evaluations for specific runs, specified as a comma-separated list of run IDs, e.g. ''1,2,3''
            /task/{ids} - return only evaluations for specific tasks, specified as a comma-separated list of task IDs, e.g. ''1,2,3''
            /flow/{ids} - return only evaluations for specific flows, specified as a comma-separated list of flow IDs, e.g. ''1,2,3''
            /setup/{ids} - return only evaluations for specific setups, specified as a comma-separated list of setup IDs, e.g. ''1,2,3''
            /uploader/{ids} - return only evaluations uploaded by specific users, specified as a comma-separated list of user IDs, e.g. ''1,2,3''
            /limit/{limit}/offset/{offset} - returns only {limit} results starting from result number {offset}. Useful for paginating results. With /limit/5/offset/10, results 11..15 will be returned. Both limit and offset need to be specified.
            /per_fold/{true,false} - whether or not to return crossvalidation scores per fold. Defaults to 'false'. Setting it to 'true' leads to large numbers of results, use only for very specific sets of runs.
