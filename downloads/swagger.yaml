OpenML will use these predictions to calculate a range of evaluation measures on the server.<br><br>\n\nYou can also upload your own evaluation measures, provided that the code for doing so is available from the implementation used. For extremely large datasets, it may be infeasible to upload all predictions. In those cases, you need to compute and provide the evaluations yourself.<br><br>\n\nOptionally, you can upload the model trained on all the input data.
