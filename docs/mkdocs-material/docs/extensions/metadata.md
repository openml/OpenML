# Metadata

The [Metadata][1] extension makes it possible to add metadata to a document
which gives more control over the theme in a page-specific context.

  [1]: https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/meta_data.html

## Installation

Add the following lines to your `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - meta
```

## Usage

Metadata is written as a series of key-value pairs at the beginning of the
Markdown document, delimited by a blank line which ends the metadata context.
Naturally, the metadata is stripped from the document before rendering the
actual page content and made available to the theme.

Example:

``` markdown
title: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
description: Nullam urna elit, malesuada eget finibus ut, ac tortor.
path: path/to/file
source: file.js

# Headline

...
```

See the next section which covers the metadata that is supported by Material.

### Setting a hero text

Material exposes a simple text-only page-local hero via Metadata, as you can
see on the current page when you scroll to the top. It's as simple as:

``` markdown
hero: Metadata enables hero teaser texts
```

### Overriding the title

The page title can be overridden on a per-document level:

``` markdown
title: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
```

This will set the `title` tag inside the document `head` for the current page
to the provided value. It will also override the default behavior of Material
for MkDocs which appends the site title using a dash as a separator to the page
title.

### Overriding the description

The page description can also be overridden on a per-document level:

``` yaml
description: Nullam urna elit, malesuada eget finibus ut, ac tortor.
```

This will set the `meta` tag containing the site description inside the
document `head` for the current page to the provided value.

### Linking sources

When a document is related to a specific set of source files and the `repo_url`
is defined inside the project's `mkdocs.yml`, the files can be linked using the
`source` key:

``` markdown
source: file.js
```

The filename is appended to the `repo_url` set in your `mkdocs.yml`, but can
be prefixed with a `path` to ensure correct path resolving:

Example:

``` markdown
path: tree/master/docs/extensions
source: metadata.md
```

Result:

See the [source][2] section for the resulting output.
