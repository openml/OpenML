# Author's notes

## Hi, I'm Martin ([@squidfunk][1])

I'm a freelance polyglot software engineer and founder from Cologne, Germany
with more than 10 years of experience in full-stack web development and system
programming. If you're interested in my projects, please see my [CV][2].

Besides my freelance work I'm currently working on Ginseng, my new company that
specializes in layout error detection developing the [Ginseng framework][3] and
a complementary service as a replacement for screenshot testing.

## Why another theme?

Some time ago I wanted to release a project to the open, but it was in need of
user documentation. I checked out the available tools and sticked with MkDocs,
because it was so simple and easy to use. However, none of the available
themes convinced me.

I wanted to build something that was usable on all screen sizes from the ground
up, something beautiful and practical at the same time. Google's Material Design
appeared to be the perfect fit and this something became Material, a Material
Design theme for MkDocs.
