To guarantee interoperability, we focus on a limited set of data formats. We aim to support all sorts of data, but for the moment we only fully support tabular data in the ARFF format. Please get in touch if you like to help us add support for new data formats.

### Format definitions
[ARFF definition](http://weka.wikispaces.com/ARFF). Also check that attribute definitions do not mix spaces and tabs, and do not include end-of-line comments.
