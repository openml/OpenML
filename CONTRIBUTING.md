### Project vision
We want to make machine learning and data analysis **simple**, **accessible**, **collaborative** and **open** with an optimal **division of labour** between computers and humans. 

### Want get involved?
Awesome, we're happy to have you! :tada: 

OpenML is dependent on the community. If you want to help, please email us (openmlHQ@googlegroups.com). If you feel already comfortable you can help by opening issues or make a pull request on GitHub. We also have regular workshops you can join (they are announced on openml.org).

### Who are we?
We are a group of friendly people who are excited about open science and machine learning. A list of people currently involved can be found [here](https://www.openml.org/contact).

### We need help!
We are currently looking for help with:
* User feedback (best via GitHub issues, but email is also fine)
* Frontend / UX / Design of the website 
* Backend / API 
* Outreach / making OpenML better known (especially in non-ML-communities, where people have data but no analysis experise)
* Helping with the interfaces ([Python](https://www.openml.org/#python), [WEKA](https://www.openml.org/#WEKA), [MOA](https://www.openml.org/#plugin_moa), [RapidMiner](https://www.openml.org/#plugin_rm), [Java](https://www.openml.org/#java), [R](https://www.openml.org/#r); find the links to GitHub repos [here](https://github.com/openml/OpenML/wiki))
* Helping with documenting the interfaces or the API
* What could we do better to get new users started? Help us to figure out what is difficult to understand about OpenML. If you *are* a new user, you are the perfect person for this!
